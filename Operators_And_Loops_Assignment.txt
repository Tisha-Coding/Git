                                                                        Operators And Loops Assignment Questions


Q1) What are the conditional operators in java?
A1) Conditional operators are used to evaluate the Boolean expressions and make decisions based on those evaluations.
    For Example :- =, <=, >=, <, >, !=, == etc are the comparison operators in java.
    Detailed Explanation Of One Conditional Operator :-
                                          int a = 5;
                                          int b = 10;
                                          Boolean result = (a!=b);
    Output :-
                                          True

Q2) What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
A2) Operators in java can be classified as :-
    a) Unary Operators :- Operators that operate on a single operand .
       Example :- +,-,!,++,-- .
    b) Binary Operators :- Operators that operate on two operands .
       Example :- +,-,*,/,%,&&,|| .
    c) Ternary Operators :- Operators that works on three operands.
       Example :- ? : .

Q3) What are the priority levels of arithmetic operations in Java?
A3) From highest to lowest , the priority levels of arithmetic operations in Java are :-
    Unary operators :-  ++,--,+,-,! .
    Multiplication, Division and Modulus :- *,/,% .
    Addition and Subtraction :- +,- .

Q4) What is the use of Switch case in Java programming?
A4) The switch case statement allows you to take decisions based on multiple choices. It is an alternative to the multiple if-else statements.
    Syntax :-
               switch(expression)
{
                    case value1:
                           break;
                    case value2:
                           break;
                    default:
}

Q5) What are the conditional statements and use of conditional statements in Java?
A5) Conditional Statements allows you to control the flow of execution based on conditions.
    Conditional Statements in Java includes:
     if: Executes a block of code if its condition is true.
     if-else: Executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block if it is false.
     else-if: Allows multiple conditions to be tested in sequence.
     switch: Selects one of many code blocks to be executed based on the value of an expression.

Q6) What is the syntax of if-else statement?
A6) if(condition)
    {
          // code to be executed if condition is true
    }
    else
    {   
          // code to be executed if condition is true

    }

Q7) What are the three types of iterative statements in Java?
A7) The three types of iterative statements in Java are : -
    for loop: Executes a block of code a specific number of times.
    while loop: Executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.
    do-while loop: Executes a block of code at least once, and then continues as long as a condition is true.

Q8)  Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop.*
   - for loop: Executes a block of code a specified number of times. The loop condition is evaluated before each iteration.
     Syntax :-
     for (initialization; condition; update) {
         // Code to execute
     }
     
   - do-while loop: Executes a block of code at least once before evaluating the loop condition. The loop condition is evaluated after each iteration.
     Syntax :-
     do {
         // Code to execute
     } while (condition);

Q9) Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
A9) public class print
    {
         public static void main(String args[])
          {
              for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)
              {
                 System.out.println(i);
          }
}
}
